# Rocket Pool Studymaster Course

This should follow the example set by the Ethereum Studymaster course.
There should be chapters based on like content with each chapter broken into research and/or reading topics followed by a quiz with multiple choice answers.
The content should cover what we most want people to learn about Rocket Pool to consider them competent stewards of the protocol. Questions can be difficult and require research. This is not an automatic pass course or a course with easy to guess multiple choice.

# Outline
Rocket Pool
Decentralised & Trustless ETH2 Staking Protocol
This course is designed to give a broader and deeper understanding of the Rocket Pool protocol. It is broken up into 69(TBD) Chapters that one can read through at their leisure. Chapters are further expanded into topics. Each chapter ends with a quiz to test knowledge of the content in that chapter. Questions may be challenging and require further research as will be noted in that topic's overview.

The student connects to the course via a digital wallet and can thus return at any time to continue from where they left off. As with the Ethereum Studymaster course, Rocket Pool Studymaster has partnered with POAP to award completion of the course with a POAP badge.  To complete the course, all questions must be answered with at least 80% accuracy per quiz. Each quiz can be retaken up to three times.

## Chapter 1 - Basics of Rocket Pool

### Topic - Brief Introduction to the Ethereum Blockchain
(as it pertains to RP. Maybe show that graphic showing the beacon chain and eth1 merge)

### Topic - Origins of Rocket Pool
Rocket Pool was founded in Australia on September 1, 2016 by David Rugendyke. Not long after, senior developer Jake Pospischil joined the team and they would work for the next years developing the Rocket Pool protocol. In 2021, after several successful beta tests and with mainnet launch in sight, Jake moved on to other projects and the team grew with the additions of General Manager Darren Langley, Senior Solidity Engineer Kane Wallmann, Senior Software Engineer Nick Doherty and Senior Blockchain Engineer Joe Clapis, an avid member of the Rocket Pool Discord #trading community who had already proven himself adept at working with the codebase when he successfully hosted a node on a raspberry pi.

### Topic - Introduction to the Protocol
The Rocket Pool Protocol is a set of code scripts and Ethereum blockchain smart contracts intended to make staking ETH possible for a wide array of users, from those with small ETH holdings or little technical knowledge, to large ETH holders, sophisticated coders and even businesses who want to provide staking as a service to their customers. This is all designed to gain the users monetary rewards while maintaining the health and decentralized nature of the blockchain.

Rocket Pool removes several high barriers to entry that will exist with Proof of Stake on the Ethereum network for both individuals, groups and businesses.

* The beacon chain requires a deposit of at least 32 ETH. Rocket Pool will allow anyone to earn rewards on deposits as small as 0.01 ETH. Registering with the beacon chain will also requires the user to have knowledge on how to interact with smart contracts. As opposed to solo staking, Rocket Pool handles all interactions with beacon chain contracts for you.

* The beacon chain will require a user who makes a deposit to be technically proficient at running an Ethereum node 24/7 and keeping that node online and secure. Rocket Pool has a decentralized network of independent Ethereum node operators that provide this service.

* Some users may be confident in running their own node but do not have the 32 ETH required for the deposit. If they join Rocket Poolâ€™s decentralized network of Ethereum nodes, they only need 16 ETH minimum to solo stake. They also get the added benefit of receiving extra income from the network for providing this service.
