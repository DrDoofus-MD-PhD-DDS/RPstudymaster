# Rocket Pool Studymaster Course

This should follow the example set by the Ethereum Studymaster course.
There should be chapters based on content with each chapter broken into a research or reading topic followed by a question with multiple choice answer.
The content should cover what we most want people to learn about Rocket Pool to consider them competent. Some questions should be difficult and require research.
This is not an automatic pass course or a course with easy to guess multiple choice.

# Outline
Rocket Pool
Decentralised & Trustless ETH2 Staking Protocol
This course is designed to give a broader and deeper understanding of the Rocket Pool protocol. It is broken up into 69(TBD) Chapters that one can read through at their leisure. Chapters are further expanded into topics. Each chapter ends with a quiz to test knowledge of the topics in that chapter. Some questions may be challenging and require further research as will be noted in that topic's overview.

The student connects to the course via a digital wallet and can thus return at any time to continue from where they left off. As with the Ethereum Studymaster course, Rocket Pool Studymaster has partnered with POAP to award completion of the course with a POAP badge.  To complete the course, all questions must be answered and at least 80% must be correct. Each quiz can be retaken up to three times.
