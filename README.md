# Rocket Pool Studymaster Course

This should follow the example set by the Ethereum Studymaster course.
There should be chapters based on content with each chapter broken into a research or reading topic followed by a question with multiple choice answer.
The content should cover what we most want people to learn about Rocket Pool to consider them competent. Some questions should be difficult and require research.
This is not an automatic pass course or a course with easy to guess multiple choice.
